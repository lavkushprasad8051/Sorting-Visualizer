# Sorting-Visualizer

<h2>Purpose</h2>

This project was originally started to get a better understanding for javascript. I also was interested in different types of sorting algorithms and wanted to be able to better visualize how they work.


The project can be accessed here:https://lavkushprasad8051.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/

<h2>How It Works</h2>
Select the algorithm you wish to see and press that algorithm icon! 
For the sorting side you can select different speeds to get a better understanding for the algorithm.

<h2>The Sorting Algorithms</h2>
The current sorting algorithms.<br/><br/>

<b>Bubble Sort</b>: A simple and slow sorting algorithm

<b>Selecton Sort</b>: A simple in-place sorting algorithm

<b>Insertion Sort</b>: A simple sorting algorithm that is more efficient than bubble and selection sort

<b>Merge Sort</b>: A efficient and stable sorting algorithm

<b>Quick Sort</b>: An efficient and quick in-place sorting algorithm

<b>Heap Sort</b>: A comparison-based  and unstable sorting algorithm
